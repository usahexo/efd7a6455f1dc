#  Master the Art of 4 Card Poker With These Tips 

Texas hold 'em (often called simply hold'em) is a variation of the card game of poker. Two cards, called hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are placed face up on the table by the dealer—a series of three followed by two. The player with the best hand using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards wins the pot.

There are plenty of ways to play 4 card poker, but the basic premise is always the same: make the best 5-card poker hand you can using any combination of your 2 hole cards and the 5 community cards. The different ways to play 4 card poker usually come down to which 3 community cards are used in conjunction with your 2 hole cards to make your final 5-card hand. With that being said, let's take a look at some basic tips for mastering 4 card poker:

1. Be Mindful of Your Hand Strength

Just like in standard Texas hold 'em, your goal in 4 card poker is to make the best 5-card poker hand you can using any combination of your 2 hole cards and the 5 community cards. However, since there are now more potential hands you can make, it's important to be mindful of your hand strength and not simply go all-in with any two pair or better. Just like in any other form of poker, always try to play the odds and make sure your hand is strong enough before risking all your chips.

2. Pay Attention to What Your Opponents Are Doing 

Another key component to winning at 4 card poker is paying attention to what your opponents are doing. Just like in standard Texas hold 'em, watching what your opponents do can give you some valuable clues as to what type of hands they may have. For instance, if an opponent reraises you preflop, they're likely holding a strong hand and it would be wise to fold unless you have a very strong hand yourself. In general, always try to keep track of what your opponents are doing so you can make better decisions about when to stay in or fold.

3. Know Which 3 Community Cards To Use 

The different ways to play 4 card poker usually come down to which 3 community cards are used in conjunction with your 2 hole cards to make your final 5-card hand. The most common way play 4 card poker is by using the flop (the first 3 community cards), but some players prefer using the turn (the fourth community card) or river (the fifth and final community card). Whichever method you choose, be sure you know which 3 community cards will give you the best chance of making a winning hand.

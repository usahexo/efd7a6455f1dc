#  How long have Genesis Casino bravo bravo mystic,Gamomat,bravo bravo mystic been in operation?

Genesis Casino has been in operation since 2018.

#  What are the minimum and maximum stakes for each game?

The minimum stakes for each game at a casino depend on the game. Games like roulette and craps have much lower minimums than games like blackjack and poker. It is important to remember that while the house edge is fixed on most games, the maximum stakes can vary.

For most games, the maximum stake limit is usually six or seven times the minimum. So, if the minimum bet at a casino game is $5, then the maximum bet would be $30 or $35. There are exceptions to this rule, of course - especially when it comes to high roller casinos or private gaming rooms. In these situations, the stakes can be much higher.

Of course, if you're playing a table game with other players, your maximum bet will be limited by what everyone else is willing to put in. This makes blackjack and poker particularly interesting games, as a player's ability to make large wagers can be greatly affected by how others are playing.

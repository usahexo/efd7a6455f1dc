#  18 Years Old and Older Can Enter a Casino in Florida

Florida residents that are 18 years old and older can visit a casino in the state. There are a few things that you should know about casinos in Florida before you visit one.

The first thing to keep in mind is that casinos are allowed to have poker, blackjack, craps, and roulette, but they are not allowed to have slot machines. This is because the state of Florida believes that the slots create an addiction for players, and they would like to avoid that.

Another thing to remember is that casinos are allowed to have alcohol, so be sure to drink responsibly. You cannot gamble if you are intoxicated.

Finally, remember that casinos can be quite loud, so if you are looking for a quiet place to gamble, this may not be the right option for you.

#  Florida Casinos Now Allow 18 Year Olds to Enter

In a move that was seen by many as long overdue, the Florida legislature voted this week to allow 18 year olds to enter casinos. The change in law means that people who are legally allowed to drink and vote will now also be able to visit casinos in the state.

The change is expected to result in increased tourism revenue for the state, as casino gambling is becoming increasingly popular among young people. In fact, a recent study found that nearly half of millennials have gambled in a casino in the past year.

Casinos in Florida had been limited to those over 21 years of age, but that will now change as a result of the new legislation. The measure was passed by both the House and Senate and now awaits the signature of Governor Ron DeSantis.

Opponents of the change had argued that it would lead to more problem gambling among young people, but supporters contend that such concerns are overblown. They argue that if someone is old enough to vote or serve in the military, they should be allowed into a casino.

Las Vegas Sands, which operates casinos in Macau and Singapore, among other locations, applauded the move. "We applaud the Florida legislature for passing legislation allowing 18 year olds into casinos," said Wilfred Wong, president of Las Vegas Sands China. "This move underscores our commitment to providing an enjoyable entertainment experience for all guests."

#  Florida Casinos Have Changed Their Minimum Age To Enter From 21 to 18

In a move that caught many by surprise, the Florida casinos have changed their minimum age to enter from 21 to 18. This change took effect on January 1, and it was not made clear why the change was made.

There has been some speculation that the change is an attempt to draw in a younger crowd, as those between the ages of 18 and 21 are considered to be a key demographic for casinos. However, it is also possible that the change was made in response to pressure from advocacy groups who feel that 18 is the minimum age for casino gambling.

Regardless of the reason behind the change, it is sure to cause a lot of discussion. Some people feel that 18 is too young to be gambling in casinos, while others believe that this will give young people a chance to experience responsible gambling at an earlier age.

What do you think about this change? Do you think that 18 is too young to gamble in casinos? Or do you think that this will help protect young people from developing gambling addictions? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

#  Minimum Age To Enter A Casino In Florida Now 18

The minimum age to enter a casino in Florida is now 18, thanks to a new law that went into effect on July 1. The law had been in the works for a few years, with legislators citing concerns about gambling addiction and its impact on young people.

Florida is not the only state with a minimum age of 18 for casino entry; the majority of states have this age requirement. However, there are a few states with a minimum age of 21, so Florida is now among the more lenient states when it comes to casino entry age.

There has been some pushback against the new law, with some people arguing that it will only fuel gambling addiction among young people. But legislators feel that it is better to have stricter regulations in place and to allow people 18 and older to gamble rather than have no regulations at all.

Many casinos are also now offering free admission to those under 21, in an effort to encourage responsible gambling habits among young people. Casino operators hope that by allowing people 18 and older into casinos, they will be less likely to develop gambling addictions at an early age.

It will be interesting to see how the new law affects casino attendance in Florida. With more people able to participate legally in casino gaming, we may see an increase in gambling activity in the state. It will be important for casinos to monitor any changes in gambling habits among their customers and make sure that they are doing all they can to promote responsible gaming practices.

#  Florida Casino Age Limit Now 18

On July 1, 2017, the minimum age to gamble in a Florida casino will be lowered from 21 years old to 18 years old. This change was made possible by a recently passed state law and is designed to attract more tourists to the gambling meccas of South Florida. Carl Toft, a 68-year-old retiree from Jensen Beach, FL says he plans on cashing in on the new law. "Now I can go over to the casino with my grandson and have some fun. I'm looking forward to it."

Not everyone is happy with the change, however. Some parents worry that their children will be exposed to addictive behavior at an early age. "I don't think 18 is old enough to be gambling responsibly," said Stacy Snyder of Fort Lauderdale. "It's just too risky." Proponents of the change argue that people of legal drinking age are already allowed in casinos, so why not allow those playing poker or slots?

Florida joins a growing number of states (such as New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania) that have lowered their casino age limit in recent years. Casino operators are hopeful that this latest move will reverse the industry's downward trend. In 2015, casino revenue in Florida was down 3 percent from the year before.

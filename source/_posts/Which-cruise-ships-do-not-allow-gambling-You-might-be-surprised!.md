#  Why don't these cruise ships allow gambling?

Aboard the largest cruise ships in the world, one will not find a single game of chance. While this may come as a surprise to some, it is actually quite common for cruise lines to prohibit gambling on their vessels. There are a number of reasons for this, but two of the most common are the impact that gambling can have on families and the potential for criminal activity.

One of the reasons cruise lines do not allow gambling is that it can be disruptive to families. Many people take cruises with their children and spouses, and they do not want those individuals to be exposed to gambling. Gambling can lead to arguments and disagreements, and it can also be addictive and damaging to families.

Another reason that cruise lines prohibit gambling is the potential for criminal activity. Gambling can be a magnet for criminals, and there is always the risk that someone will get hurt or that property will be stolen. Cruise lines do not want to have anything to do with criminal activity, and they believe that by prohibiting gambling they are helping to reduce the risk of such incidents happening.

#  What are the benefits of cruising on a ship without gambling?

The cruising industry has been around for centuries, with the first cruise taking place in 1844. Since then, cruising has become a popular vacation choice for people around the world. Despite its popularity, there’s one aspect of cruising that many people don’t know about – you don’t need to gamble to enjoy a cruise.

There are many benefits to cruising without gambling. For starters, it’s a lot cheaper. Cruise fares typically include your accommodation, all meals, and all onboard activities. There are no hidden fees or surcharges, so you know exactly how much your cruise will cost upfront. In comparison, gambling on a ship can be expensive. The average casino gambler loses $615 per trip, which can quickly add up if you’re on a longer cruise.

Another benefit of cruising without gambling is that it’s a lot more relaxing. There’s no need to worry about losing money or making bad bets – you can simply relax and enjoy your time onboard the ship. There are also plenty of activities available for non-gambling passengers, including pool parties, live shows, shopping excursions, and more.

Finally, cruises without gambling are perfect for families and those who want to avoid casinos and other gambling areas onboard the ship. If you have children with you, they will be able to enjoy the pool areas and other family-friendly activities without having to worry about casinos and adult content.

Overall, there are many great reasons to cruise without gambling. It’s cheaper, more relaxing, and perfect for families. So if you’re looking for a fun and affordable vacation option, consider cruising without gambling – you won’t regret it!

#  IRS Gives Tips on How to Report Your Big Thunder Game Winnings

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released new guidelines on how to report your winnings from gambling, such as playing at the Big Thunder casino in Reno.

“The new guidance is designed to help taxpayers understand and correctly report their gambling winnings and losses,” said IRS spokesperson Gina Harris.

According to the guidelines, taxpayers should report their Big Thunder game winnings as “Other income” on their federal tax return. This includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and other types of betting or wagering.

Taxpayers should also report any related expenses, such as gambling losses. These losses can be deducted from your gambling winnings to help reduce your tax liability.

The new guidelines also provide information on the special rules that apply to certain types of gambling income and losses. For example, taxpayers can deduct their losses up to the amount of their winnings for casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and craps. But for race track wagers, players can only deduct their losses up to the amount of their winnings minus any commissions paid to the house on those bets.

If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income and losses, please consult a tax professional.

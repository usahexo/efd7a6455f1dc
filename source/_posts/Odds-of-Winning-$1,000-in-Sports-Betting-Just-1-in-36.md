#  Odds of Winning $1,000 in Sports Betting Just 1 in 36

Odds of winning $1,000 in sports betting are just 1 in 36, according to a recent study by the University of Iowa.

To win the $1,000 prize, a person would need to correctly predict the outcome of 36 consecutive sporting events.

The study found that gamblers who bet on individual games had only a 2.7% chance of winning money in the long run. That number jumps to 9.4% for those who bet on multiple games at a time.

But even if you're extremely successful at picking winners, your odds of winning $1,000 are still low. The chances of picking the outcome of 36 consecutive games are just 1 in 36 trillion.

That's why it's important to only bet what you can afford to lose, and not to base your entire financial security on success (or failure) in sports betting.

#  Baseball Betting Odds 'Shifted' After Yoenis Cespedes Signing

The baseball betting odds have shifted after the New York Mets re-signed outfielder Yoenis Cespedes. Cespedes, who rejected a $110 million offer from the Mets in November, agreed to a three-year, $75 million contract with New York on Monday.

The move has given the Mets (+275) a better chance of winning the World Series than the Toronto Blue Jays (+450), according to Ladbrokes. The Boston Red Sox remain the favorites at 3-1, while the Chicago Cubs (+600) and Washington Nationals (+700) are also among the front runners.

"The market's spoken and people believe that the Mets will be better with Cespedes back in their lineup," said Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes.

Cespedes hit .280 with 31 homers and 86 RBIs last season for the Mets, who acquired him from Detroit at the trade deadline.

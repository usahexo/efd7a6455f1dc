<h1 id="Why-is-Earth-Day-celebrated"><a href="#Why-is-Earth-Day-celebrated" class="headerlink" title="Why is Earth Day celebrated?"></a>Why is Earth Day celebrated?</h1><p>Exactly 47 years ago, on April 22, 1970, the United States Congress passed a law establishing Earth Day. President Richard Nixon then signed it into law. The idea for such a day had been floated about for a few years before that, with influential people like Senator Gaylord Nelson pushing for it.</p>
<p>The motivation for Earth Day was twofold: to celebrate the planet and to push for environmental protection legislation. At the time, there was growing concern about things like pollution and litter. The first Earth Day was marked by rallies, protests, and teach-ins around the country.</p>
<p>Since then, Earth Day has continued to be observed annually on April 22. It’s now a worldwide event, celebrated in more than 192 countries. While the focus has shifted somewhat over the years – from conservation to climate change – the overall mission has remained the same: To raise awareness about environmental issues and promote positive change.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to get involved in Earth Day festivities. You can participate in a local event, or simply take steps to reduce your carbon footprint throughout the year. If you want to learn more about what you can do to help protect our planet, visit earthday.org/ready.</p>

The day commemorates the birth of the modern environmental movement, which is often credited to former United States Senator and environmental activist Gaylord Nelson.</p>
<p>The first Earth Day was held in 1970 and focused on protesting the negative effects of pollution. Since then, the day has evolved into a celebration of all things eco-friendly, from reducing energy consumption to reducing waste.</p>
<p>Many eco-conscious companies and organizations participate in Earth Day by hosting events or releasing special products. For example, this year Google celebrates Earth Day with a doodle that features a planet-shaped pinwheel made of recycled materials.</p>
